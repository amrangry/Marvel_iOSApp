# Application Description / Details:

The data is available by connecting to the Marvel API
(http://developer.marvel.com/).

# Story
List of Characters
In this view, you should present a list of characters loaded from the Marvel
API character index. Notice that the when reaching the end of the list, if there
are additional results to show, you should load and present the next page.
Filter Results
When tapping on the magnifier icon, you should be able to search for
characters by name. To do this, use the same endpoint used to list characters
and use the name param to filter results.

Character Details
When selecting a character, you should present a detail view of that
character. Most of this information is already available on the result of the
first API call, except for the images to be presented on the
comics/series/stories/events sections. Those images can be fetched from the
resourceURI and should be lazy loaded. That same behavior is expected
when expanding those images.
